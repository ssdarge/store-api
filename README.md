# Store API

The **Store API** project is designed to provide a backend service for an e-commerce application. It allows a frontend (e.g., a React or Vue.js application) to:

- Retrieve a list of products.
- Filter products based on various criteria.
- Sort products.
- Select specific product fields.
- Paginate through large product lists.
